% Misclassification analysis should play a prominent role in published classification research. In the past, researchers have focused on building classifiers without discussing classification errors, which significantly degrades the contribution to the body of knowledge. Such discussion helps us explain classifier performance 

% The results show
% the classifier more accurately classifies low entropy data, similar to past research findings.


% Scalability could also be improved via a hierarchical classi-
% fication approach, since it reduces the number of classes. In a
% hierarchical classification approach, a file fragment is classified
% into one of several large categories and then further classified
% into a specific type within the category, which may not even be
% needed in all cases.
