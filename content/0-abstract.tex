The studies on file fragment classification use different sets of file types to compose their datasets. This raises the question of how this difference impacted the results, and if these results are comparable.
This study started with the verification of a previous observation that the number of file types in the dataset influence the accuracy of the resulting models. While a trend in this direction exists, the simple count of file types was found to be less influential than the specific choice of file types: some file types when included in the experiment have a much higher negative impact than others.
